    "flavor": "Poliwrath is a blue, bipedal Pokemon with muscular arms. It has bulbous eyes that protrude from the top of its head. Its belly is covered by a white and black swirl. There appear to be white gloves on its hands, and it has rounded, digit-less feet. It has powerful muscles in its arms and legs that never tire. When it swims, it uses all the muscles in its body, and is able to swim vast distances with minimal breathing. It is even capable of briefly running on the water's surface. Poliwrath, despite being an excellent swimmer, usually lives on dry land near the water's edge. ",
