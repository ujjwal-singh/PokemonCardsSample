    "flavor": "Venomoth is an insectoid creature with a light purple body. It has bulbous, round eyes with large pupils and a small mandible. Its thorax is paler with several black, zigzagging stripes running across the horizontal length. It has six short legs and a three-point crest on its head. Its two pairs of wings are covered in dust-like, purple scales that vary in color depending on their toxic capability. Dark scales are poisonous, while lighter scales can cause paralysis. These scales are released when Venomoth flutters its wings. Venomoth live in dense forests with much undergrowth and little light. As a nocturnal Pokemon, Venomoth comes out at night to hunt of its favorite prey. It prefers to feed on insects that gather around light, and Venomoth is attracted to bright lights itself. ",
